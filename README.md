User Story #211906: JQuery: Racing Textboxes App
------------------------------------------------

> - [ ] Create a "race" app.
>
> - [ ] Your app will let the user enter the name and distance to travel of 3 separate
>       "racers" - in our case, let's just make these textboxes.
>
> - [ ] The textbox represents how much distance that racer still has left to go.
>
> - [ ] The user can enter the racer's name directly in the textbox.
>
> - [ ] There will be 4 buttons.
>
> - [ ] Under each racer name, there should be a "Go!" button.
> - [ ] Clicking that button will start that racer racing.
> - [ ] The racer box will get smaller as he runs the race. (Hint: Use .hide for this).
> - [ ] You can click the "Go!" buttons one at a time to start the racers at various
>       handicaps and see who wins.
>
> - [ ] There should also be a "Go All!" button that starts ALL the racers going for
>       their appropriate distances.
>
> - [ ] Change the racer's textbox color when they "Go!" Use different colors for the
>       different racers.
>
> NOTE: You don't need to make any racers go faster than the others. This is just about
> moving certain distances.
